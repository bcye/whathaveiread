WHIR - What have I read? Is an iOS app that allows you to keep track of all books you've read and keep a short summary about them.

## Installation

This project uses CocoaPods, but the `Pods` directory is checked into this repo, so no `pod install` is necessary. However, be sure to do your work in `WHIR.xcworkspace` instead of `WHIR.xcodeproj`.
